Here is a picture of how the game looked like. Note that the pictures displayed on the board is not the best quality because of the board's screen low resolution.
The pictures displayed on the screen are just ingredients used in the game such as onions. When the joystick is moved you can select the ingredients as the two white lines
between the ingredient will be colored in yellow. Then when the button is pressed while the ingredient is selected the ingredient is added to the plate
